This is a javascript based paper game.

If you can play the beta Version right here (it may take a time loading):
http://bobmcfry.github.io/autorennen/
after that read from point 3 on.

Elif you want to get the code to run at your machine do the following:
To start the PreBeta version follow these steps:

1: clone/download everything

2: open autorennen.html in your browser

3: Now you can choose a car and a track. If you chose "own" follow the steps 3.1 to 3.4. If you chose some predefined Track, jump to step 3.4.

3: After hitting Play you can draw on the canvas in the following way:

	3.1 dragging the mouse over the canvas will paint a line and
	generates points afterwards. These are the borders.

	3.2 if you *shortly* click into a *closed* region the points will
	be generated inside of this region. these are surrounding points of
	the track

	3.3 If you are ready to draw, simply hit the Done Button (might be a
	little hidden) and then you can paint the finish line. make sure to 
	paint at least 4 dots.

	3.4 if you are done, you hit "done" and then you can choose 4 points
	of the finishLine to be the starting points.	

4. Now the game starts and you can play AUTORENNEN.

The goal ist to reach the finishLine at first. You can only click on regions that are not borders and surrounding.
Good Luck!
